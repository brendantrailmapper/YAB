/**
 * Node's resolution algorithm for "import" statements is
 * described here: https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_resolution_algorithm
 *
 * To sum it up, there are 3 kinds of specifiers (the thing you import):
 *
 *  - relative: './startup.js' or '../config.mjs'
 *    (and if I understand correctly "/root/module.js"
 *
 *  - bare: 'some-package' or 'some-package/shuffle'
 *    Like in CommonJS, module files within packages can be accessed by appending a
 *    path to the package name unless the packageâ€™s package.json contains an "exports" field,
 *    in which case files within packages can only be accessed via the paths defined in "exports".
 *
 *  - absolute: 'file:///opt/nodejs/config.js'
 *
 * Node resolves relative and bare specifiers the same way, that is, just following
 * the URL spec (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) to load the resource.
 *
 * The most important things to note from the resolution algorithm are:
 *
 * For relative specifiers the algorithm states ("URL resolution"):
 * ================================================================
 *
 *    - "No default extensions"
 *
 *    - "If the file at resolved is a directory, then Throw an Unsupported Directory Import error."
 *
 *    - "If the file at resolved does not exist, then Throw a Module Not Found error.""
 *
 *    This means that if you write: import './file', Node won't try to load './file.js' like
 *    it would have with require() - either './file' is an actual file and Node will throw
 *    an 'ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION' error, or it is a directory, and since we are resolving
 *    a relative specifier, the algorithm stops here
 *    and Node will throw an 'ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT' error.
 *
 *  For bare specifiers (a.k.a. packages):
 *  ======================================
 *
 *    The algorithm is much more complex. Following is what I take away from
 *    from reading the spec that may be useful for this program.
 *
 *    General principle
 *    -----------------
 *
 *      Like before, the algorithm looks at the 'node_modules' folders in the
 *      parent hierarchy of the module performing the 'import', including of
 *      course the folder of the importing module, and stops at the first
 *      'node_modules' directory that it finds.
 *
 *      e.g. if a module '/a/b/c/alice.js' does an "import 'bob'"
 *      then Node will check the existence of:
 *      - /a/b/c/node_modules/bob
 *      - /a/b/node_modules/bob
 *      - /a/node_modules/bob
 *      - /node_modules/bob
 *      and this step of the algorithm stops at the first folder found
 *
 *    A few definitions
 *    -----------------
 *
 *      - The << package name >> is either the full specifier, or the part until the
 *        first "/" if there is one,
 *        except if the specifier starts with an "@", in which case it also needs
 *        to contain a slash ("/") and the package name is then defined as
 *        what comes after the first "/"
 *        until either the end of the string or the next "/" like for regular
 *        package specifiers
 *        e.g. "@types/babel" has "babel" as package name, "@a/b/c" is named "b"
 *
 *      - Then Node defines the << package sub-path >> as:
 *        "." + specifier.slice(packageName.length),
 *        i.e. "." concatenated with the part of the specifier that comes after
 *        the package name if there is one, e.g. "./promises" for "fs/promises",
 *        or "./safe" in the case of "colors/safe" (which is the package that led me down
 *        this rabbit hole of reading the full spec because I cannot do
 *        "import colors from 'colors/safe'" - it throws an 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND')
 *
 *    The algorithm as I understand it
 *    --------------------------------
 *
 *    Once Node has found a suitable folder in a 'node_modules' folder,
 *    it first checks if it contains a 'package.json' file.
 *
 *    If there is no 'package.json' the module is loaded as a directory,
 *    using the legacy algorithm. I don't know how this works and I don't
 *    think it's very relevant for my use case.
 *
 *    If the 'package.json' file is invalid then an error is thrown.
 *
 *    If the 'package.json' has an "exports" key, there is a messed-up
 *    algorithm describing how to map the package sub-path to an actual
 *    file.
 *
 *    Thankfully Webpack describes it in an easy to understand way:
 *    https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/
 *
 *    If there is no "exports" key in the 'package.json', then the module
 *    is resolved using the standard URL resolution algorithm with
 *    the sub-path as URL and the package's folder as the current directory.
 *
 *
 * CONCLUSION:
 *
 *  - My problematic "colors/safe" module that I cannot "import" has no "exports"
 *    key in its package.json, so Node will treat it as
 *    a relative import (relative to the module's resolved root folder), so my program
 *    needs to append a ".js" in this case too.
